PHYSBE is a classic model of the human circulatory system. The specifications 
for the model were first published by John McLeod in 1966 in an article titled, 
"PHYSBE...a physiological simulation benchmark experiment". PHYSBE models blood 
flow as a transport mechanism, and can be used to simulate the flow of oxygen, 
nutrients, heat, or chemical tracers within the bloodstream. It is also a good 
example of a non-linear continuous system. 

To open the model (and the graphical user interface), just type "physbe" at 
the MATLAB command prompt. 

The PHYSBE demo has been built using Simulink v3.0. It will not function with
earlier versions of Simulink. The MathWorks web site contains a 
PHYSBE Web page which describe the entire system in detail. 

The PHYSBE page contains images of all block diagrams, a listing of all 
parameters, and a reference section with several related web sites and journal 
articles. Goto http://www.mathworks.com/physbe.

    Requires Simulink 3.0 or higher
