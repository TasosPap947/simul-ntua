SOFTWARE  LICENSE AGREEMENT 
SAAM II SOFTWARE

This is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) 
and SAAM Institute, Inc., a Washington business corporation ("Licensor"). 
By opening the sealed Software packages and/or installing, copying or 
otherwise using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this 
Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor 
is unwilling to license the Software to you.  In such event, you may not 
use or copy the Software, and you should promptly contact Licensor for 
instructions on return of the unused product(s) for a refund.

Grant of License:  Subject to the provisions contained herein, Licensor 
hereby grants to you a non-exclusive license to use one copy of the version 
of the accompanying proprietary Software product, which may include user 
documentation (collectively the "Software") on a single computer 
(i.e., central processing unit), provided the Software is in use on only 
one computer at any time.  If you have multiple licenses for the Software, 
then at any time you may have as many copies of the Software in use as you 
have licenses.  The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded 
into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the permanent 
memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer. 
The license granted under this Agreement does not grant you any right to 
any enhancement or update to the Software.  Enhancements and updates, 
if available, may be obtained at Licensor's then current standard pricing, 
terms and conditions. Without prejudice to any other rights, Licensor may 
terminate this Agreement if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement.  In such event, you must cease using the Software and 
destroy all copies of the Software and all of its component parts.

Copyright:  All title and copyrights in and to the Software (including any 
images, applets, photographs, animations, video, audio, music and text 
incorporated into the Software) , and any copies of the Software, are owned 
by Licensor or its suppliers, and no title shall pass to you. The Software 
is licensed, not sold, and is protected by copyright laws and international 
treaty provisions. You must treat the Software like any other copyrighted 
material (e.g., book or musical recording) except that you may either 
(a) make one copy of the Software for archival purposes, provided such copy 
contains all of the original Software's proprietary notices, or (b) transfer 
the Software to a single hard disk provided you keep the original solely 
for backup or archival purposes.  You may not copy the printed materials 
accompanying the Software.

Other Restrictions: You may not (and may not permit any other person to):  
(a) modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble (except to 
the extent the foregoing restriction is specifically prohibited by applicable 
law), or create derivative works based on the Software; (b) permit other 
individuals to use the Software except under the terms listed above; 
(c) rent, lease, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer rights 
to the Software; or (d) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Software.

Limited Warranty: Licensor warrants that the Software will perform substantially 
in accordance with the accompanying printed materials for a period of 
ninety (90) days from the date of receipt. Any implied warranties on the 
Software are limited to ninety (90) days. The above limited warranty is void 
if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, 
or use on a computer system for which it was not designed.  Licensor does not 
warrant the operation of the Software to be uninterrupted or error-free, nor 
does Licensor make any warranty or representation regarding the use or output 
of the Software, medical or non-medical, in terms of correctness, accuracy, 
reliability or otherwise. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations 
on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

Customer Remedies:  Licensor's entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall 
be, at Licensor's option, either (a) return of the price paid, or (b) repair 
or replacement of the Software that does not meet Licensor's limited warranty 
and that is returned to Licensor with a copy of your receipt. Any replacement 
Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period 
or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  Outside the United States, neither 
these remedies nor any product support services offered by Licensor are available 
without proof of purchase from an authorized source.

No Other Warranties:  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor 
disclaims all other warranties, either express or implied, including but not 
limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular 
purpose, with respect to the Software (including accompanying written materials).
This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have others, 
which vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction.

No Liability for Consequential Damages: To the maximum extent permitted by 
applicable law, in no event shall Licensor or its suppliers be liable for any 
damages whatsoever (including without limitation damages for loss of business 
profits, business Interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary 
loss) arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, even if Licensor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and Licensor's total 
liability to you or any other party shall in no event exceed the price paid 
for the license of the Software, regardless of the failure of other remedies 
under this Agreement.  Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, 
the above limitation may not apply to you.
